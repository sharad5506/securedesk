# 🚗 Vehicle Service Management System (VSMS)

A web-based application built using **Python Flask** and **MySQL** that automates and streamlines the process of managing vehicle service requests. This system allows service centers to manage customers, mechanics, service histories, invoices, and parts inventory efficiently.
